        <p class="noteheading">Why we do what we do and how to do it better?</p>
        <p class="notepagemoral">What you do in dark puts you in light.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="notepagecontent">As human beings, there are very simple and basic necessities we need to survive, they are food, water, shelter, sleep and clothing. But is this all we want to get happy? Certainly not, unless you are a monk.
          So arriving at the point, what are the things that drive what we do?
          Well at the fundamental level are two things, fear of consequences and our Wanting of pleasure and experience (emotional feelings). These are the two, nothing else.
          Fear of consequences and wanting of pleasure and experience drives everything we as humans do.
          Let me explain them with the example:
          Do you remember the last time you woke up much earlier than you usually do, what made you do that, missing out on your flight or something ( fear, you see?)
          Or your excitement to see the sunrise or to visit someplace (experience, wanting, you see?)
          Or working late nights because of your employer’s deadlines (fear)
          Or overnight to make more money for something? (Wanting, experience)<br>
          <br>
          <img src="photo.jpg" alt="phototest" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;">
          <br>
          <br>
          So, now when we clearly understand why we do something, It’s time to do it better and more excitingly.<br>
          Coming to the stuff we do because of fear and pressure, well it’s simple and much easier to make your mind to do something which you and your mind are already under pressure of, basically it encourages us in disguise. So we can’t do much in here to improve our situation other than working on that task happily,<br> so stay calm and happy when such situations occur and enjoy them, rather than regretting not doing them in the past when deadlines are closer, or for something that occurred or happened to you. Regretting and getting sad only makes it difficult and worse.
          Regretting and getting sad for something that can’t be changed only makes it difficult and worse.<br>
          Now the experience and wanting part —
          This is the tougher part, well because these things usually don’t have deadlines, there is no deadline for you to start working on your startup idea or going to the gym,<br> which has been on your tasks list from weeks, there is no external pressure, nobody is bothering you to do those things, and so you can’t make it up because it seems hard to get started with that thing, when so much is happening around us, and we want to do so much other things, we all have been there, even if we define deadline for such tasks for ourselves we just can’t get them right, we just procrastinate, well because that always feel easier.</p>
