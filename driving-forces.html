        <p class="notepagemoral">Excitement and fear drives us, leverage them.</p>
        <hr>
        
        <div class="notepagecontent">As human beings, there are very simple and basic necessities we need to survive, food, water, shelter, sleep, and clothing. But is this all we want to get happy? Certainly not, unless you are a monk.


          <br> <br>
          So arriving at the point, what are the things that drive what we do?

          <br> <br>
          Well at the fundamental level are two things, <strong>Fear</strong> and <strong> Excitement</strong>. These are the only two natural motivators, nothing else.

          <br> <br>

          Lets see with a few examples : 
          <br> <br>

          <ul> 

          <li> Do you remember the last time you woke up much earlier than you usually do, what made you do that, missing out on your flight or something with consequences ("fear") </li>
<br>
          <li>
            To run a city marathon ("excitement")
          </li>
<br>
          <li>
            Working late nights to meet the deadlines to not face consequences ("fear")
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            Completing your work asap to get home to celebrate your kids birthday ("excitement")
          </li>
        
          </ul>

          <p><strong>So, now when we clearly understand why we do something, it’s time to do it better and with more energy and enthusiasm.
          </strong></p>

          <p>Firstly, coming to the things we do because of <strong> Fear </strong> and pressure, well it’s simple and much easier to make your mind to do something which you and your mind are already under pressure of, basically it encourages us in disguise.

          </p>

          <p>So we can’t do much in here to improve our situation other than doing it happily or staying neutral, so stay calm and don't be sad when such situations occur, regretting not doing them in the past or why it happened to you, only makes it difficult and worse.

          </p>

          <p>Now the <strong>Excitement</strong> part —
          </p>
<p><strong> This is the tougher part</strong>, well because these things usually don’t have deadlines and no external pressures, there is no deadline for us to start working on our startup idea or to go to the gym, which has been on our tasks list from weeks, months or years.

</p>
<p>There is no external pressure, nobody is bothering us to do those things, and so we can’t make up our mind because it seems hard to get started with the thing, especially when so much is happening around us, and we want to do so many things, we all have been there, even if we define deadline for such tasks for ourselves we just can’t get them right and done, we just procrastinate and redefine the deadlines again and again, well because that always feels easier.

</p>

<p>Remember the last time, you hit the snooze button of your alarm, what you were thinking while snoozing it? Was it something like I can do that thing a little late, or that’s not important enough, or maybe I will find another way to get that done.

</p>

<p>But how it would have felt if you woke up exactly at that time alarm rang and accomplished that task, rather than sleeping? Great? Won't it. But that didn’t happen.

</p>

<p>
Now, Did it hit your mind? a little, maybe? but if you have to do something similar tomorrow morning? Would you be able to make it? Your will is little strong now, ain’t it? But probably not strong enough to push you out of your bed tomorrow morning.
</p>

<p> <i>
  "You are free to make your choices but not escape the consequences of it."
</i>
 </p>

<p>But what if I had to tell you, that whatever you want to do (say exercise tomorrow morning), write that down with a pen in a personal notebook, and be specific (like here, I will wake up at 5:00 am tomorrow morning and go for exercise by 6:00 am), write whatever you want to do with specific details, then you will be much more interested and excited to do them, won’t you? you certainly will be, try doing it.
</p>
<p><i>Be specific and clearly define goals to make your mind more interested to act on them.
</i></p>

<p>
  But even sometimes that doesn’t work because we are forcing ourselves to do that, but what if we could motivate ourselves to do that specific thing, that would make it five times easier (and I have done this), write all the good and exciting things that will result if you do that specific task, next to it on your task list and believe me, this will not only make you accomplish those tasks easily but also make you happier and enjoy the process and journey.
